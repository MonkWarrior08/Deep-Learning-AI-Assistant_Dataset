# Deep Learning AI Assistant

A sophisticated deep learning system trained on extensive educational datasets to create an adaptive AI tutor, leveraging GPT-4o's capabilities through fine-tuning with specialized pedagogical conversation patterns and expert teaching methodologies.

### OpenAI Setup

1. Create an OpenAI account and obtain an API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create a fine-tuning job with the following parameters:
   - Epochs: 10
   - Learning rate multiplier: 2
   - Batch size: 1

### Knowledge Base Preparation
1. Academic Resources:
